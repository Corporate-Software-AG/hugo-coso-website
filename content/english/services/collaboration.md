### CoSo Voice Service – Teams telephony from a single source

Talking to teams on the phone? Absolutely and uncomplicated. Especially the last few months have presented many companies with a challenge in terms of communication technology. Many have to work from home and still need all the technical possibilities analogous to the office, since the main tasks require telephone contact with the customers.

With the CoSo Voice Service, Corporate Software offers the ideal solution to enable employees to work remotely/hybridly, to abolish local hardware at several locations and to modernize the telephone system solution to integrate new functions.

#### Modern communication and collaboration functions

CoSo has developed the Coso Voice Service to help their customers get the most out of teams. CoSo Voice Service is a collection of cloud solutions delivered as a service that extend the standard offering of Microsoft Teams. It allows businesses to use Microsoft Teams based on Microsoft 365 cloud to make and receive external calls without the need for Microsoft Calling Plan licenses. The service is connected via Sunrise/UPC Business Solutions. MS Teams is connected to the public telephone network using the Business Voice IP PBX Service from Sunrise/UPC.

Why Corporate Software? With us as an implementation partner, you benefit from an establishment by the certified expert: Since August 2021, we have been an official Microsoft Gold Partner with the Advanced Specialisation in Calling for Microsoft Teams. During the project, we will guide you from A to Z through the migration and transition to a fully managed support service.

#### Your advantages at a glance

* One application for everything: Simplify team collaboration with one tool thanks to telephony, chat, screen sharing and document storage.
* Modern Management: You benefit from granular policies, flexible licensing and call analytics.
* Little effort when switching: You do not need your own SBC and no hardware. You can easily transfer and continue to use your previous phone numbers.
* Use on the go: The telephony functions can be used anywhere and on any device with Microsoft Teams
* High voice quality: The robust and powerful connection to the Microsoft Cloud ensures high voice quality
* Security: Communication between MS Teams and UPC Business is encrypted and correspondingly secure

#### How does the implementation work?

1. In an initial workshop, we will introduce you to Microsoft 365 and the MS Power Platform and explain the possibilities and limitations of Teams Direct Routing, the telephone system and the telephony part of the Teams client
2. In a requirements analysis, we jointly determine your business requirements
3. In addition to telephony, our solution design also includes power platform functionalities, so that we can cover all the specific needs of your company. Together we define the configuration and the migration approach
4. With the help of a proof of concept with live integration in your tenant, you can experience how much added value the solution generates for your environment. In the course of the PoC, we configure the tenant, the telephone system, the main number with Auto Attendant and a call queue
5. Finally, the configuration of the productive Teams telephony follows
6. To ensure that the Teams telephony functions can be used productively from day one, we train your employees in the new applications
7. In hour-long Q&A sessions with all employees or with your superusers, we clarify current questions and challenges
