title = "How the Rhaetian Railway Democratizes Its Data"

+++
 **The Rhaetian Railway, in many minds as a holiday railway in romantic memory, makes steam on a completely different level: in the future-oriented handling of data. The vision of Meinrad Hidber, Project Manager for Data Science at RhB, is based on a good Swiss tradition – it is about nothing less than the "democratization of data". Julia Moser from Corporate Software is also on the train as a companion for Microsoft Power BI.**

Meinrad Hidber manages the digital shunting plant in the RhB's "Data Science" project. It sets the course between people, business and technology. "I am a business economist by training, for 15 years as an IT consultant in the HR department. Now I'm bringing this knowledge to the RhB," says Hidber. It is essential to consider such a project in the context of the digital transformation comprehensively with the human being at the center. "There is a lot of new, unknown things coming to our organization. We are not only introducing new technology and workflows, but also a different way of thinking, new roles, new expectations – a great transformation with all the fears, uncertainties and courageous steps that are simply part of such a comprehensive change. We are only at the very beginning," Hidber sums up the first two years of the project since 2018.

Julia Moser from Corporate Software will join in May 2020. Their mission: To use Power BI from Microsoft to develop new workflows, visualizations and reports for the requirements of PowerUsers. It forms the frontend of the project. "Julia Moser transfers the new mindset to the power users with the report architecture and the corresponding trainings she designed. Away from static Excel reports, towards interactive self-service dashboards," says Hidber about Julia's role in the team.

### The Big Picture

RhB's project is large and complex. Since 2017, there has been a Group-wide digital strategy, the "Big Picture", as the orientation is called internally. "Data science is part of the digital strategy. A data science project should definitely be placed in a larger context that is supported by management," recommends Hidber.

In 2018, Hidber was allowed to start the Data Science project – with the support of the top management. This gives the project the necessary legitimacy, as the first step was to identify the most diverse data pots in the company and to integrate one isolated solution after another into the new data warehouse on Microsoft Azure. "The technical was demanding, has now been gradually solved, we have comprehensive information from various business areas. However, we have not yet generated any added value. This only happens when our employees use the data in such a way that they jointly derive insights from it and systematically make data-supported decisions," says Hidber.

Hidber sees at least two challenges: "On the one hand, RhB has noticed that it has defined process owners and application owners, but no data owners. We want to know exactly who is responsible for which data. It's about consistency, data sovereignty, validity – we want clarity about which data is valid and how valid and who is allowed to decide on a change in the data master. This is the only way to get a uniform picture of our entire company," says Hidber, explaining the importance of data governance in the project.

Hidber continues: "On the other hand, the data only comes to life when it is effectively applied by our employees and thus creates added value – and this is where Julia Moser from Corporate Software comes into play."

### Democratization of data

The steps in the data science project outlined above have one goal: the democratization of data. "My task is to define the cases with the power users in such a way that the added value of the new solution becomes intuitively clear to the users. I design the architecture of the report creation and then create templates and visualizations that can be further edited by the users themselves," Julia Moser summarizes her contribution to the project.

The architecture is based on Microsoft Power BI. Julia Moser trained RhB employees in the use of Power BI even before she was involved in the project. The motivation of the employees is great, all the more so as the first reports are now moving into live operation. "The punctuality report now visualizes the entire Route Network of the RhB in a map view and shows with colors where delays occur. The respective responsible persons can immerse theself in the visualization live with colleagues and leadership and get to the bottom of the causes together and interactively. That was not possible before. The added value is obvious," moser is pleased about the first successes with the end users.

### Empowerment for self-efficacy

In the future, Moser will train the users directly in the jointly defined use cases so that their competence is gradually transferred to the RhB. "My aim is to support the people at RhB in such a way that they can tailor the reports and evaluations themselves according to their individual business challenges," says Moser. Only in this way can the goal of democratization be achieved. "It is not enough that the data is available. Only when everyone has the necessary skills to apply the data meaningfully for their specific role within the RhB can we speak of a democratization of the data," Moser continues.

This includes not only knowledge of Power BI, it is about collaboration, personal responsibility and innovation, which happens bit by bit through many small innovations. "At Corporate Software, we interpret our role as external parties in exactly the same way: We work interdisciplinary, contribute our business and agility expertise in addition to technology and Microsoft product knowledge, and wish for a co-creative exchange with our customers on an equal footing. The newly developed RhB environment fits in like a fist to the eye."

### Every sprint a bit better

Every two weeks, the team delivers its latest developments. "Sprints" are the short cycles in which the team works on the solutions in its own coordination. Julia Moser as an external consultant is part of the internally and externally mixed RhB Scrum team, which focuses on architecture, data warehouse,

Report workflows and visualizations. And can thus take on their role as externals holistically.

"This project organization corresponds to me. I can get involved directly, so I have an influence on the project at any time, even as an external expert. I can immediately address things that no one else might have seen or said – even about areas that are not directly in my role definition. So we are incredibly stable as a team and complement each other wherever possible," Julia sums up her role. The agile approach, which enables IT professionals, data scientists, data architects, business users, clients and Julia to work closely together in a team for Power BI, is a key to success for Hidber.

"We have already taken advantage of many learning opportunities," he says with a smile when he talks about how they had set up the project classically as a waterfall project at the beginning. "We were rather slow, too far away from the business, our first proof of concept was almost forgotten by users after six months of development." Meanwhile, the dev team invites to a review meeting every two weeks, shows its new developments and hands over use case by case to the company. "The trust within the development team and with the stakeholders around us increases from sprint to sprint. Because every two weeks we communicate our results and successes transparently and respond to new requirements of our co-designers," Moser emphasizes.

### The future is "Open Data"

"We are only just beginning to discover the huge potential of data science," says Hidber. "With our new collaboration, we are dovetailing technical development, knowledge of the tools and a new culture of agility and self-empowerment. This puts us at the forefront as a company, this project and our entire digital strategy is absolutely state-of-the-art. The Rhaetian Railway is going full throttle."

In the future, the democratization of data should not only take place internally. RhB plans to share its data on public platforms such as Open Data, thus making the data available to third parties for new ideas. This opens up the boundaries of the company and innovation can happen from anywhere – internally and externally. Hidber and Moser are both proud: "With the strategy of democratizing data, we are making a contribution that could not be more contemporary. It combines technology with business and gives people the responsibility to use the data to develop themselves and their organization."
