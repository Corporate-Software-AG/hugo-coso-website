In order to improve the content of our reporting and automate the process, we use Power BI for different scenarios. Roman Kahr from Corporate Software provided us with professional support both conceptually and in the implementation of our reporting environment. As part of the ongoing "Consulting for Reporting and Power BI" assignment, Corporate Software creates reports and further develops the reporting environment together with us. "Were you skeptical at the beginning whether you would have the right contact person with us?" No, right from the start we had the impression of winning a specialist in Power BI as a partner in Corporate Software and Roman Kahr, which was absolutely confirmed in the course of the cooperation.
