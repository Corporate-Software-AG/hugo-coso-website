For the introduction of Office 365, we needed fast and reliable support. In particular, we focused on an introduction and conception for Microsoft Teams, and the architecture of Azure and Office 365 as well as the management and evaluation of the corresponding licenses. Thanks to the very pleasant cooperation with corporate software, our employees received a comprehensive overview in individual and holistic training courses as well as a tailor-made introduction to the Office 365 platform. "How do you rate the cooperation with us?" We particularly appreciate the high level of expertise and flexibility.
