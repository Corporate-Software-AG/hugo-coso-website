For the central storage of various vehicle data, we set up a document library on SharePoint Online. In the test phase, it quickly became apparent that the search and filter functions were not user-friendly and too slow, especially on mobile devices. By programming the optimal solution proposals of the corporate software team, on the one hand the creation of a mobile app for our vehicle database – compatible for all operating systems, as well as on the other hand a suitable search web part for the application in the browser was realized. "Can you benefit from the result?" The new solution simplifies work, especially for mobile workers. You now have access to all important documents on the go and find them very quickly thanks to the sophisticated search and filter functions.
