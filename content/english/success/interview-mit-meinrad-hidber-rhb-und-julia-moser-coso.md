 **The Rhaetian Railway, in many minds as a holiday railway in romantic memory, makes steam on a completely different level: in the future-oriented handling of data. We spoke to Meinrad Hidber, Project Manager for Data Science at RhB, and Julia Moser from Corporate Software, who is on the train as a companion for Microsoft Power BI.**

_Mr Hidber, Mrs Moser, think back to the time before the project. What were the key challenges of the RhB in general at that time?_

Hidber: Our first key challenge was to formulate exactly this. Data science was and still is relatively new to us. So how should we formulate our vision and our challenges in such a way that we fit into the company and into the context around us? We would like to establish a new way of dealing with RhB data. Two years ago, we managed to integrate our vision and mission into the digital strategy of the entire company.

Moser: Although I didn't join the project until 2020, for me the vision is clear and simple: the democratization of data. Sure, that still offers a lot of leeway. For me, it's about everyone in the company being able to help shape things and come across valid data with which employees can independently generate insights for their work.

_What solutions came to your mind?_

H: The first thing we had to do was to prepare a basic paper. Here we worked together with external parties who knew how to prepare our case in such a way that the

Management understood the meaning of the project. This company continues to be part of our team and is responsible for architectural concept and implementation. Now we are in the next phase, where the data comes into operation. Now we're focusing on the reporting architecture, visualization, and training on Power BI with Julia Moser of Corporate Software.

_What was the most important goal of this project for RhB?_

M: The way I interpret my role, self-empowerment is the most important goal for me. I want to train the power users so well that the project becomes a self-runner.

H: It's really about democratizing data. First and foremost, internal open data structures and the appropriate governance at the moment. External open data is also planned: We provide our data for third-party platforms, e.B. puenktlichkeit.ch. The community then makes exciting things out of it, e.B animated colors of trains for different delays.

_Who was involved internally and externally?_

H: At first we started internally, but soon we encountered challenges that we didn't want to solve on our own. One of them was the already mentioned creation of the concept. Since our IT manager is also an advocate of agile methods, we decided to implement an approach according to Scrum in an interdisciplinary team of internal and external employees. Our former Head of Controlling takes on the role of Product Owner and is responsible for the backlog. I myself take on the role of Scrum Master and am responsible for the quality of cooperation and dealing with obstacles. The development team includes a data scientist and three external consultants from two companies, one of them Julia from Corporate Software.

M: I find this agile project management very successful. As a team, we now learn every two weeks and deliver our latest developments to the specialist team. The specialist team is also involved in the team as stakeholders and is invited to our reviews.

_Mr. Hidber, how did you come up with corporate software?_

Corporate Software was already in our house when it came to the conversion to Microsoft 365. We have introduced a new intranet on SharePoint, in this project Matthias Gessenay, one of the two founders of Corporate Software, accompanied us. Over lunch, we talked about the possibilities of Microsoft Power BI. During the training courses, we were able to get to know and appreciate Julia Moser.

In addition, we also have internal resource bottlenecks in the field of computer science. Julia not only knows Power BI, but is also well acquainted with data architectures on Microsoft Azure. That's why we integrated them into the dev team after the training. The trust is right.

_Ms. Moser, which two or three things in cooperation do you appreciate the most?_

I really appreciate the close connection between internal and external project staff. From the beginning, I knew exactly how and where I could get involved and my contributions were implemented immediately. For example, my proof of concept is now part of the data architecture, although I actually work in a team on the subject of reporting. The proximity to the specialist departments helps me to tailor my solutions exactly to the needs, the positive feedback motivates me.

What I also really appreciate about the project is that we as a team have the expertise to design the entire data process: from the source data to the Azure platform to the reports and the ad hoc requirements of the professionals. We not only have the technical competence, we are also allowed to make decisions.

_What resistance arose during the project?_

H: Actually no resistance, the anticipation of and the meaningfulness for our project is seen by everyone. What we are working on is to achieve this changed handling of data and thus the change in our own understanding of roles.

For example, we have process governance, clarity in application governance, and data governance is still missing. We have not yet fully defined the roles, we are in the middle of a complex finding phase that has a lot to do with change. Who is Data Owner or Power User and what tasks and responsibilities do these people have? Who does what in the integration route? What does the role of a data engineer, data architect or data scientist include?

Sometimes it also proved problematic when we connected a new data source and users wanted to access it immediately before we clarified all the details in the process. Here we were sometimes too early.

_Which successes stand out the most for you?_

H: At the beginning of 2021, the new reports on punctuality went live. The reports are visually easy to understand and allow the team to interactively search for causes of delays and solutions. The acceptance of the new solution has greatly improved compared to the old management information system, and satisfaction has increased. Thanks to automation, everything runs faster and productivity is significantly increased. In addition, many professionals now have their own access to data and reports. The quality and consistency of the evaluations will greatly improve throughout the company. Previously, each area used its own data pools, so comparability of the reports was difficult.

M: The processes for reporting are and are constantly being automated, and Power BI reporting is completely self-supporting. There are almost no more efforts for IT and specialists. Numbers that previously had to be collected for hours in Excel now come automatically at the push of a button. In addition to automation, new evaluations are possible because numbers were not available before. Hopefully, this will lead to the desired qualification of the specialist employees.

_What has touched them most in the cooperation so far?_

M: How I can, may and should get involved. I'm part of the team, I don't feel external and therefore outside the RhB.

H: The performance curve is continuously upwards. In my sandwich position, I also feel the pressure from above, but the team is fully involved. The human is right in the team.

_What challenges do you see in the future?_

H: The topic of data governance and role definition will keep us busy for a while. The awareness that data is important and what we can do with it will evolve. We are still at the beginning and now at the transition from data warehousing to data science. This is a giant elephant that needs to be sliced. To do this, we need applications with benefits that create enthusiasm. We are talking about lighthouses.

We are now architecturally well positioned for data science. With the introduction of our new ERP system, however, new possibilities are already being added. We cannot rest on our laurels, the integration of data is constantly continuing.

M: That RhB makes the leap to promote its own talents and build up the know-how internally. This new role of professional users is a cultural change that goes further than the data science project. A rethinking is taking place: everything can be made easier, new patterns are developing – this is not always the case in a traditional company like RhB. Freedoms are not accepted, continue to be delegated. Most see the benefits and are very positive. I am also confident, but I see a big challenge here. In my opinion, more explicit change management is needed.

_What would you recommend to someone who now faces the same challenge?_

M: Identifying scattered systems and storing them centrally, in principle: Create a source of truth on which to build. Correct data and clarity as to where the right data lies is key.

My recommendation: Before you start, clarify the requirements. What do we need as a company, what do we need professionally, what do we expect? Sufficient time should be invested for this. It is recommended to proceed in an agile process that is open to change.

H: Start by formulating a big picture – e.B. as a digital strategy approved by the management. This clarifies expectations and gives the data science subproject the necessary legitimacy and embedding in the overall context.

As soon as the big elephant is clear, then I recommend agile working, in very small steps, always having successes, discarding the thinking of large projects. Do not write large specifications. From my point of view, regular coordination with specialist users is very important for success. The business users inspire for the right setting of priorities.

Waterfall in data science doesn't work well. In agile working, long-term plans are missing, but the big picture sets the direction. It takes a vision, followed by small steps, whereby successes become visible again and again.

When working together, I recommend investing in trust and having patience for technology. We have gained experience: It didn't happen as quickly as we thought at the beginning. The road is long and complex. Having patience is important in this project, which fuses technology, business and culture.

In addition, I would always involve the management and the various stakeholder groups in the communication. Our stakeholders should always be able to provide an answer to where the project currently stands. With us, everyone is invited for planning and review, can simply get involved. Our claim is: We have done such a cool thing that our stakeholders absolutely want to be there.

The Agile has absolutely proven itself. My extended team is now also being converted in an agile way. Consultants like to be at RhB, we offer a good culture like a family, which promotes self-drive. Establishing such a relationship of trust is my last recommendation.
