Finally the time had come: Our Bot in a Day Workshop in cooperation with Microsoft!

We were very happy about the existing interest and a fully booked seminar. On Wednesday, our coaches Raphael FÃ¤h, Julia Moser and Thomas von Mentlen finally welcomed the numerous participants. After a short introduction to the background, the areas of application and integration possibilities of bots, the participants were already able to start their first own project. In this practical part, a bot was built that could provide users with information on public transport connections between different cities. During the exercises, the participants were always supported by our trainers and were able to benefit from their expertise and experience. In addition, they had the opportunity to contribute their own ideas for implementation and were advised by Raphael, Julia and Thomas.

When the participants thanked them for the exciting course at the end of the day, we knew: That was a complete success! We are already looking forward to the next time when it says again: Bot in a Day!
