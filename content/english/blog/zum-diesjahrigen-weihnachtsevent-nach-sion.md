For yesterday's Christmas event we went early in the morning towards Sion/Sion in the beautiful Valais.   
There we visited Realfly to try skydiving. After an introduction by our instructor Eric, it went high up - an incredible feeling and recommended to everyone :)  
  
For lunch we walked into the old town and then got a very nice and interesting city tour including wine tasting at each historic building. Afterwards we enjoyed the late afternoon with generous aperitif platters in a wine bar.

Afterwards we drove to Thun to end the successful Christmas event in a well-known steak house there.

We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year :)
