Thomas von Mentlen – our Cloud Consultant & Bots Mentor congratulated Primo Amrein, Cloud Lead at Microsoft on a year of "Swiss Data Center" and asked him his burning questions about his experience with the Swiss data center, security in the cloud, cognitive services, Microsoft's support of NGOs, the use of MS platforms in schools, Microsoft's near future plans and his first computer.

**With the cloud to more security **  
What Primo Amrein, Cloud Lead at Microsoft, is increasingly noticing is that there has been a massive rethink in the area of cloud and security. Two or three years ago, customers did not go to the cloud due to security, today it is exactly the opposite. Customers want to go to the cloud because of security.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
Before the cloud arrived, what was your first operating system that you came into contact with? Completely detached from the cloud context.

**Primo Amrein: **   
My first operating system was an AmigaOS on the Commodore – the bottom line was that it was a game computer. Because neither then nor now I was extremely into the technology, so I could show you any specifications now. But that's how it started with me.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
For me, it was a Mac OS 9. I first grew up with Apple and at some point I also made it to the "other" side.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
Basically, how satisfied are you with the cloud adaptation in Switzerland?

**Primo Amrein: **   
We are very satisfied. But of course it is always a question of what kind of starting position you have. Some customers have been in the cloud for a long time, which is why we were allowed to push the Swiss data center internally. And we knew that certain industrial sectors are still very cautious. With the Swiss data center, we were able to bring a lot of momentum into the current situation. Of course, we were realistic and didn't even expect the tide to turn 180 degrees within a year and all companies to go 100% to the cloud. What we have achieved is that we have set a lot of motion in the very restrictive and regulated industries on a broad basis, where there were still concerns before. Of course, not everyone is in the cloud yet, but there are a lot of new projects underway.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
Do you think that Switzerland as a location has contributed to this more open mindset, or is it more because the cloud has become a little more popular?

**Primo Amrein: **   
It's certainly a combination. It has helped massively that you can see from abroad that the cloud is successful. And I believe that even if there were no Swiss data center from Microsoft, then some customers would have migrated to the cloud despite everything.

But it's the combination that makes it all. Because even if most customers have no legal requirements, then it plays an emotionally huge factor to know the data safely in Switzerland. I think this has contributed enormously to the changed mindset.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
What impact does the repeal of the EU-US Privacy Shield, i.e. the Privacy Shield in July of this year, have on us and, above all, on the Swiss data center?

**Primo Amrein: **   
We expected this, because it was only a matter of time before Switzerland followed suit in accordance with the court decision in the EU. We have an official Microsoft blog post on the ruling from the EU, in which it is clearly stated that we have had multiple protection for a long time. Now that Privacy Shield is no longer sufficient, we still have the standard contractual clause.

And what I would like to say is that this is only the case if data flows effectively into the USA. This is exactly the reason why we offer Switzerland and, of course, Europe as a storage location.

In addition, in addition to the storage location "encryption", an important topic is also recommended by the Swiss Federal Data Protection Commissioner.

We are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation right from the start – we comply with the GDPR / GDPR of the EU and we comply with the Swiss Data Protection Act.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
I would like to talk about Cognitive Services. For me as a developer, it is very interesting whether the Cognitive Services will also be available in the Swiss data centers in the future or whether I will have to switch to containers?

**Primo Amrein: **   
There is a distinction between cognitive services. The services, in which the data is not only aggregated or anonymized, but effectively individual data is processed, are introduced locally over time. In this way, we ensure that sensitive data does not leave Switzerland. It always depends on how the customer uses the data of the Azure services.

In concrete terms, this means that we expect Azure Search in the coming months. This is one of the first to come in the field of cognitive. After that, services such as Face, Language Understanding, Indexer Services such as Video Index are introduced step by step on a quarterly basis.   
The Cognitive Services, which effectively only process "aggregated" data, will not come to Switzerland until further notice. These can still be obtained dynamically from Dublin or Amsterdam.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **  
What does the customer have to consider or how can he prepare if he wants to use cognitive services such as language understanding and thus certain data flows into the USA.

**Primo Amrein: **  
First and foremost, the most important services are safely available in Europe, if not in Switzerland, then safely in Amsterdam. Many points have already been addressed in this way.

But if a customer wants to use a service that is effectively hosted only in the USA, then we recommend that you make a clean risk assessment to weigh up the use, especially for sensitive data. But basically, this is part of the homework when using sensitive data, not only for the cloud, but also for all other areas, so that the management has made a risk assessment. As a customer, you have to check whether you want the data to go to the USA as part of a risk assessment.   
What is exciting is that we are noticing a massive rethink in practice. Two or three years ago, customers were not in the cloud because of security. Today it is exactly different, customers want to go to the cloud because of the security.

From the point of view of renowned Swiss lawyers in this area, what can often be seen is that the risk in the area of security on-premise is greater than the risk that you have in the cloud.   
But of course, this is very individual and must be analyzed cleanly.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
As a customer, why should I choose to migrate to Azure Cloud to Switzerland or Amsterdam rather than migrate to Google Cloud or AWS – Amazon Web Services?

**Primo Amrein: **  
On the one hand, it is certainly a big difference whether I have the opportunity for a local Swiss data storage or not. This is where AWS comes down. In addition, we have the advantage over others of being able to offer a complete cloud offering:  
With Azure on the infrastructure side as well as PaaS Services and with Cognitive Services & AI.   
With Microsoft365 on the Modern Workplace side and with Dynamics365 for CRM and ERP.

We often see that customers typically have Office 365 first because they email accordingly, share documents and use the calendar. Often customers and partners realize later that they already have an Active Directory, so the identities have already been set up and are therefore already in the cloud.  
This means that we have a lot of synergies when you go in the direction of Azure or Dynamics and that is exactly our big hobbyhorse, the overall platform Approach for our customers.

And we benefit from the fact that we have been in Switzerland for over 30 years and have built up a very established partner structure. With our more than 4,600 partners in Switzerland, we have a very good network and can pick up our customers locally via our partners. Because we don't scale alone, we only bring it to the ground with the support of our partners.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
What do customers need to look for when choosing a Microsoft partner for the cloud?

**Primo Amrein: **   
As a customer, I would primarily pay attention to what the partner's expertise is. Certain partners focus on special cloud offerings – on special industries or expertise in regulated companies.  
If I am a FINMA regulated bank, then I would make sure that the company has already worked with such a client and has been able to successfully launch such a project. I.e. expertise and reference.  
Another topic is, of course, the quality of the advice. What do the employees bring with them, what certifications do they have and what successful projects do they have in their backpack?  
For me as a customer, it would also be important how strongly the partner can respond flexibly and purposefully to my own individual needs.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **   
You also have a "non-profit" customer segment. I myself am in the Jungwacht and have registered for "Stifter-helfen" – the IT portal for non-profits for our small group. We get Office 365, SharePoint, Teams and 3'500, - CHF Azure credit. Really cool, we can do a lot with it. Supporting NGOs is probably a kind of dissemination strategy – how do you see that?

**Primo Amrein: **  
This is very sympathetic to me, I was personally with the scouts for many years – with the same basic idea as with the Jungwacht: a meaningful occupation for young people and adults who want to do something good.

It sounds very high, but as a large company we want to take on a social responsibility to help such clubs and organizations. For example, we have a public reference for the Microsoft Cloud in Switzerland with the WWF. And there are others in this area who benefit from it. We certainly also have an interest in bringing people closer to our own platform, just as other companies do. In the education sector, we sometimes issue licenses free of charge if someone is still in school or a student. We have an education team that has supported many schools. Not least in the hot COVID-19 phase in March and April 2020, for example, this was enormously appreciated.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **  
What do you think, when is a sensible time to bring digitization in general and platforms such as teams to the children. Now I'll talk briefly about my mother from experience – she is a teacher for "third graders" and thinks that this will be more interesting from the fifth grade.

**Primo Amrein: **  
Through my children, I have seen that the introduction in the upper school was a good fit. My son is in the fourth upper grade, i.e. at the grammar school, my daughter just in the first grade of the upper school when they started. In younger classes, some of them already from the third grade, I have heard from my colleagues that it certainly makes sense for certain things and for getting a taste of it. Pure teaching only with teams I would consider too early at this age. There it needs accompanying support from the teacher or parents during this time.

But of course it is already the case that you are confronted with it earlier, not only in terms of Microsoft products. The children are already much further along today, every teenager used to have a mobile phone and that helps them to get in touch with the technologies.

I personally believe that it needs a balance. A child should be allowed to stay a child and just play or go to the forest instead of just hanging on to electronic media.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **  
There was a Monday morning during the Corona phase, when the use of Microsoft's free offers led to a one- to two-hour outage of teams. How did you perceive that? How did Microsoft react?

**Primo Amrein: **  
The problem was mainly in Amsterdam. Something like this can always happen, just as data centers and on-premise systems can sometimes have a problem.

It was certainly a very unfortunate time. We worked very additional capacity to ensure that this problem does not occur again in the further phase.   
Although we are always prepared for growth and build in buffers, one must not forget that this happened at a time when we had explosive growth. On the one hand, it was due to demand, on the other hand, we had difficulties with supply chain management at the same time, as we could not buy new servers en masse because China was at a standstill.

Fortunately, in order to limit the risk of geopolitical tensions and the cessation of import and export, we temporarily stored certain material in larger department stores around the world and were very happy to be able to fall back on them at that moment.

Now things are going great again and we have never had a failure since the beginning of the Swiss data center. There is always a residual risk.

**Thomas von Mentlen: **  
What are the additional plans you are aiming for in the near future?

**Primo Amrein: **  
The next big step, or the last big launch step, will be the Dynamics Launch. We have planned this for the end of the calendar year. That's where we'll come up with the first Dynamics workloads, especially in the area of CE Customer Engagement. This information is public and there is a roadmap page that explains which modules we have planned. At the same time, PowerApps and Power Automate will come, Power BI we have already launched in June 2020

**Thomas von Mentlen: **  
If we, as COSO, wanted to congratulate the Azure Datacenter, what could we do?

**Primo Amrein: **  
Please help to forward the message to customers. We have learned throughout the year that you should constantly maintain a good flow of news and information so that the local offer gains attention.

And it helps us a lot if you continue to provide concrete customer references that can be talked about publicly. What you already do at Digicomp. We strongly support this. Experience shows that the Swiss want to see if something has worked. This helps both of us as a win-win.
