Jonas, Markus and Sebastian were at the Kursaal in Bern today on the first day of the Microsoft TechSummit switzerland.

The annual TechSummit is a truly inspiring and technical event for developers and IT pros to gain deep insights into upcoming releases and future developments. As expected, today's keynotes focused on open source, cloud computing, mixed reality and AI, with an impressive demo of the new HoloLense 2. The even stronger partnership between Microsoft and SAP was also addressed and it was announced that they are working hard to make the SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with Azure available in Switzerland. Which is excellent news for us, as we have been able to count SAP among our partners since this January.

Due to our close cooperation with Digicomp (which is represented there with its own stand), it is also an excellent opportunity for us to show the presence of corporate software.

In addition, tomorrow there will be the opportunity to attend a wide range of exciting learning sessions in which one's own skills can be further deepened. We are curious!
