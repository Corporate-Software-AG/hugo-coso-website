CoSo celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2021. Where did the success story begin? And what will the next 10 years look like in the cloud? Here's what Patrick Sommer, co-founder, and Matthias Gessenay, co-founder and CEO, have to say:

### How did CoSo come about 10 years ago?

_Patrick: _ I realized very quickly that I would be happy to go the extra mile if something grabbed me and I liked it.  Already in childhood I was fascinated by game consoles and electronic kits, so I wanted to do something with computers professionally. 

In my professional career, like many others, I changed jobs every 3 to 5 years, because I often got bored once I understood the business. For a customer project, I was looking for someone who would complement me and how I would be willing to take on new challenges again and again. "Das isch dr Start vor Zämearbeit mit em Matthias gsi."

Since working with him was very inspiring, I realized that I wanted to do more with Matthias.

_Matthias: _ Patrick and I met in a joint project and noticed that we share the vision of modern working – at that time still very classic on SharePoint. Today, you can communicate with each other at any time and from anywhere and use and share your data. 

We were both already independent and were able to draw from an abundance.  

During the collaboration in the project, it became clear to me: Here is space and motivation for more. I believe in encounters and have followed my impulse. And so the ground was prepared for the company – modern and from the beginning in the cloud. 

### What makes CoSo so successful?

_Patrick: _ Looking back, our success in self-employment started with the fact that you are good on your own, but fantastic as a couple. One and one gives three. We complement each other perfectly. 

Matthias is the technology-savvy, I am driven by the business benefits. Matthias brings the big, innovative ideas. I'm bringing these to business. 

For further growth, we realized that we do not have to look for abilities, but character traits.  

After intrinsically motivated people who, like us, can deal with uncertainty and new flexible working.

_Matthias: _ I think the most important criterion for success is that we have never decided to found a company together out of a lack, but in abundance. We worked from the future, not from the past. Because we were both already independent and successful.  

In addition, we can talk well with each other. I experience that you help each other – in a group – to compensate for the one-sidedness.

And in retrospect, my many changing courses of study benefit me and make sense. Because my theology studies paved the way for me. I know how relative I am, and I'm grateful for what I'm allowed to create. That still nourishes me today. In my studies of economics, I learned the economic contexts, the pedagogy helps me to give my trainings. And I met Raphael.

### What customer problem does CoSo solve?

_Matthias: _ We go ahead and experience what we sell. We had to go through the cloud transformation ourselves personally. If Microsoft comes with a big change tomorrow, we can live with it.

Uncomfortable is the new "normal". And that's exactly why customers trust us, even though we bring disruption.

Today we are spending time on how we can draw answers for business from the large number of data. And so we always go one step ahead and take others with us – technically and probably also humanly.

### Where does the name CoSo come from?

_Patrick: _ Actually, it was very unromantic. But also very pragmatic: Our business is already very software-heavy. Internally, it turned out that we all call ourselves CoSo. That's why we are now taking this to the outside world.

### What is your mission of life?

_Patrick: _ With Raphael, our first employee, everything made a higher sense, because in addition to the IT business, we both realized that we are also mentors of people and companies that we accompany into a new world of work. That is our mission.

_Matthias: _ My real motivation to get out of bed in the morning is probably to become a better person. My task at CoSo today is to grow through disruption – to courageously show the technical direction, to design architectures, to give confidence in constant change, to make a clear decision for or against projects if I have the impression that the order suits us or the customer. And I believe in encounters. 

### What do you want to give others for a successful working world?

_Patrick: _ I think the most important thing about working together in this uncertain world is mutual trust. Matthias and I held our management meetings while walking before Corona. It's about being present, everything you forget is unimportant and the way sets the time, so you are more efficient. As a human being, I have never really looked for security and maybe it needs this certain basic trust. One of our hiring criteria, for example, is that we hire a person if we were to have a beer with that person. Then it was already worth it.

_Matthias: _ I believe that success can only grow from the inside out. When you reflect on yourself with your values and habits again and again. If you don't take yourself so seriously and learn not to be afraid of uncertainty. I don't know if our customers can name it – but they perceive it: We are just as radically changing with ourselves as we are with our customers.

What will CoSo projects look like in 2031?
