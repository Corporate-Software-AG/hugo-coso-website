On Friday last week, we opened our new program as part of a kick-off: "CoSo Academy" :)  
We want to give the new juniors a successful entry into the world of business and IT and promote and support them in the best possible way!   
In the CoSo Academy, they are prepared to get started as consultants in our areas, to work successfully with customers, to be active in projects and to hold training courses.  
Above all, however, the focus is on our juniors. Because it is important to us that they feel comfortable and above all safe in their activities, the CoSo Academy is a flexible program that is tailored to the needs, working methods and time budget of the participants.   
  
We and your gods Raphael, Noah and Roman are very much looking forward to the next 6 months with you: Jonas, Sebastian, Robin B. and Thomas.
