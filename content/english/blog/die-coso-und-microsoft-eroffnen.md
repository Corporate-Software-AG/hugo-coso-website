Would you like to introduce Microsoft Office 365 and do not yet know what challenges there are to consider? We are at the Smart Working Day of Digicomp on 28.11.2019 and look forward to showing you our practical tips around the entire collaboration track and our own experience as a virtual team. Together with Martin Janisch from Microsoft Switzerland, we will open with the topic of how you can also use artificial intelligence in Microsoft Office applications. The COSO - as cloud natives, we lead the way to enable you to take the next step towards a successful collaboration.
