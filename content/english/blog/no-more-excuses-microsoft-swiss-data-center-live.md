Finally, the time has come: Today, Microsoft's Swiss Data Centers officially go live and enable access to the hyperscale cloud with data backup in data centers in Switzerland.

Swiss cloud services such as Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics 265 are particularly interesting for the financial and healthcare sector, but also for the public and strong NGO sector, as they all handle sensitive data. Like the global cloud services, the data centers in the Zurich and Geneva regions are based on data protection, compliance, security and transparency. The hyperscale cloud is an innovation platform for global and local companies â€“ an infrastructure for innovations like the Gotthard Tunnel once was. With the new ability to store data in Switzerland, Microsoft offers additional control options and supports companies as well as organizations and institutions in meeting regulatory requirements.
