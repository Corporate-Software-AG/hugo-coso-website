The Department of Education of the Canton of Bern awarded us the contract for the creation of the architectural concept with regard to the renewal of the basic infrastructure of EDUBERN. This is based on cloud technologies such as Office 365 and Azure Services.

Based on cloud experience, best practices and current and foreseeable technical possibilities as a serving basis, a future-proof architecture for service provision within the framework of EDUBERN for the 32,000 users is to be designed cost-efficiently, value-added-oriented and in accordance with the specifications by the end of the year.

We are very much looking forward to working together!
