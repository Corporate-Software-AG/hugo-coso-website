Today it's that time again: for the second time, rav Zurich is holding the jobs scouting event together with Microsoft Switzerland.  
After it was successfully carried out in the spring and some seekers received a permanent position, we are curious to see what awaits us today.  
Patrick and Johanna, together with 16 other MS partners, will therefore be looking for new talents for us today in the premises of Microsoft :)
