Roman participated for us at this year's Power Platform Summit in Amsterdam. As the name suggests, this event revolves around Microsoft's Power Platform: Power BI, PowerApps, and Flow. As part of the three-day event, this year's roadmap was presented and various new features were presented. The main focus was on the integration of AI into the platform. In the future, Power BI will get interfaces to Microsoft's cognitive services and an integration of machine learning in which you can develop your own models.

PowerApps and Flow are being greatly developed so that enterprise business solutions can be created even more efficiently and integrated into the existing environment. For example, Flow gets the possibility that external users can also approve tasks!

All in all, it was a very good and informative event with a great community.
