**Free setup of Office 365 Education to set up express distance learning in schools.**

Not much has changed for our work situation in the last few days. But everything revolved around us. We would therefore like to offer our help in this emergency situation.

Matthias one of our founders is a trained teacher and knows what is important in the field of education. That's why we want to help schools in this emergency situation with an express setup of Office 365 (Education) with Teams as a collaboration platform to introduce the virtual classroom.
