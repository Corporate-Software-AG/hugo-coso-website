Martin is currently training as a computer scientist Way-Up at Swiss Post. In his practical year, he is allowed to sniff fresh company air and now enriches the CoSo team! Before Martin moved into IT, he made exciting excursions into the fields of human medicine and physics. When he's not tinkering in front of the PC, he plays football or sticks his nose in a book. Martin is also very interested in AI and the possibilities it offers.
