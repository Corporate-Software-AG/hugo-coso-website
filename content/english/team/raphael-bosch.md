Raphael is a real Microsoft-ler. Before we could grab him, he worked for Microsoft Switzerland for over 10 years. Our customers benefit accordingly from his extremely broad know-how around Microsoft solutions. Raphael is an over-the-top watcher. It is important to him to constantly expand his horizons. He also does this well and gladly in order to understand the needs of our customers and to implement them with the right technology.

His biggest hobby is his junior and when he has time for himself, his motto is: The main thing is fresh air!
