Julia always wanted to be an astronaut, but since the chance of flying to the moon is very low, she decided to go on the adventure of business informatics. Here, too, uncertainty and trust in oneself and technology are crucial.  

Julia is a specialist in simplifying and automating business processes through PowerApps and Flow. She combines this special field with her know-how for collaboration in order to develop customer-oriented solutions. She is currently training as a Microsoft Certified Trainer.
