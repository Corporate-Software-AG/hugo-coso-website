Hekuran moved to Switzerland at the age of 2. Football and its open culture have helped him to integrate quickly. That's why it's important to him that everyone in the group feels comfortable quickly. In 2019, Hekuran started in DevOps at CoSo and is mainly active in the field of automation. There he mainly deals with PowerShell.
