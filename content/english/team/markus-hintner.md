There is hardly a question in the field of collaboration that Markus cannot answer. Thanks to his research and tinkering soul, he assembled his bike from parts of the scrap yard according to his own needs as a child.

Markus has made a name for himself in the field of Microsoft 365 as a consultant and developer as well as a troubleshooter. He is a Microsoft Certified Solutions Master and Trainer and passes on the details of Microsoft 365, Azure and SQL Server to his customers in trainings and projects.
