Johanna prefers to manage several weddings at the same time, anything else would be too boring for her. What she used to look for in competitive sports in martial arts or dancing, today her two children, her husband, her dog and profession give her. Her talent for bringing many things together at the same time can be wonderfully used in project and lean management. At CoSo, she is on the road wherever there is a need for women – according to the motto: learning by doing.
