Noah is a business informatics student at the University of Fribourg. Although he had not been able to gain much experience in IT in high school, he was seized by curiosity about innovation and digitization. He is most interested in innovative software applications. His goal: to make our lives easier and more effective. That's why he is also involved in the power platform sector at CoSo. In addition to his interests in digitization, Noah likes to travel and go on trips and excursions with friends as well as doing sports or in the mountains.
