Absorbing and passing on knowledge is what motivates Tamara. Not for nothing, she has been working at CoSo since January 2021 as a consultant and trainer, where she can pass on her experience. Whenever possible, the nature enthusiast spends time outside biking, ski touring, snowboarding or on the steep wall. She feels comfortable in a team when she is in good hands in an agile, well-functioning team with motivated teammates and can concentrate entirely on the efficient design of processes for business.
