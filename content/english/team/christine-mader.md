Christine is originally a bookseller with a penchant for languages. After completing her apprenticeship, this also led her to study translation. The topics of people, change, organization and communication have occupied her on all her stations. She has experienced many changes herself and experienced how change can inspire if you design it holistically and humanely.

Christine has been supporting CoSo since the end of 2020 in the areas of marketing and communication and as a mother of two with tightrope nerves and a feeling for nuances as a "good soul".
